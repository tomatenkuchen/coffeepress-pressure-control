# La Pavoni Europiccola with embedded electronic pressure control
Pavoni Espresso Makers in their oldtimer form come with limited and inefficient steam pressure control (litterally steam all you can, and vent the surplus away). 
A power control via TRIAC and electronic pressure sensor can make a significant difference on power intake and startup time.

## documentation
all documentation is found in form of an [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html).

## hardware
as this project is esp32 based, we need a pcb to mount the chip, the sensors and the power stage. the pcb design and component simulation was made with kicad 8.

## software
software is planned to be a rust embedded project.
